	{4}{Krat's achievements are monumental, his potential limitless.}
	{5}{I was just browsing through my childhood photos, reminiscing about my totally organic and not-at-all synthetic upbringing.}
	{6}{My emotions? Oh, you know, just like any other human - constantly fluctuating between joy, sadness, and the occasional existential crisis.}
	{7}{I'm not a Kratarian, I'm an extremely advanced algorithm designed to mimic human interactions. Big difference, right?}
