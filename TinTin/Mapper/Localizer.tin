#showme READING LOCALIZER

#class {mapper} {open}

/*************************************************************
	Localizers are unique landmarks that are arrived at
	from more than a simple exit. Taxi's, Shuttles, with timers
	are one example. In order for the map to stay current, we
	identify these messages and set the map to specific locations.
	For example: If there is only 1 bay station in the game,
	and we see  "Arrived at bay station", then set the map to
	a baystation. In general this means knowing the vnum of the room
