The lurking haze sweeps about the field, as glowing beads of water and fog twist around each other in constant battle. }

Around the sides and the back are dark grey pieces of plastic that look like they hold the mask in place. The helmet is in perfect condition. This armor has the following resistances: 9 edged, 9 blunt, 9 fire, 9 acid, 9 electric It looks light.   As you step through the very large garage door in the entrance of this autorepair shop, you get the strong scent of motor oil and burning rags. There is a large sign hanging over the door, and large lights hang from the ceiling shining down on the car that looks to be under repair below them. It looks as if this shop is very heavily used by someone. Dark shadows flicker from the corners of the garage. This probably isn't the best of places for someone who's not from Detroit and has never worked in a greasy repair shop in the middle of a gang district. }

It stinks like two week old vomit and penetrates your nostrils with incomprehensible fury. The air is moist and makes it difficult to breathe. There is evidence of hunting season with shredded animal pelts scattered over the swamp floor. The sound of native birds send shock waves through the swamp completely shattering your confidence. Every direction you take could potentially land you in a creek, on a track or trampling through more swamp. The swamp is enclosed by an extremely tall rocky cliff face, it is far too tall to climb. }

The wooden handle on this has some burning done to it.  The owner must be a fan of the Green Bay Packers because there is a big 'G' on the grip with some other scribblings around that.  Although small, if used in experienced hands, this could be a weapon for things other than the dead fish it normally sees. This weapon is in very good condition. This weapon deals edged damage. This weapon is class 6 (edged).  This weapon gains benefits from your dagger weapon skill. It looks light.  Deadman: 0 After dropping the line in the water, you wait for signs of even a nibble.

How these rare stones are able to grow upon the dragon's skin has been a source of myth throughout Overlands. Some say the Promethian Dragons are Samantha's pets and she magically altered them to be the finest beasts to roam the land.  The aristocracy of Overlands would pay any price for this find.  Though these scales seem to offer virtually no protection against any sort of attack, an aura of magic pervades the lattice of gems. The cloak is in perfect condition. It has a magical glow about it. This armor has the following resistances: 1 edged, 1 blunt, 6 mind, 6 energy It looks light.  Deadman: 0  Deadman: 0 }

The milky white ivory comes second to only obsidian in its durability and hardness.  You could sell it to a blacksmith to melt down and craft into whatever he wills\; or you could sell it on the black market for the assassins guild to use as is. This weapon is in excellent condition. This weapon deals blunt damage. This weapon is a class higher than 15 (blunt)  This weapon gains benefits from your dagger weapon skill. You must be level 10 to wield this weapon. }

It is stained with the blood of countless lost adventurers.  The talon is made of midnight black ebony and is razor sharp.  This device is very popular among the secret assassins guild beneath Casaria according to rumors one hears in the various inns throughout Overlands.  It has therefore been declared illegal to possess one.  However, this would be worth a hefty price on the black market, for vampire dragons are nearly impossible to kill.

The grasses make it difficult to see any lurking foe.  An island of serenity in an otherwise chaotic setting, the parkland is filled with waving long grasses, and offers through its open setting a fine opportunity to view the city beyond its borders.  Through thick trees and overgrown brush you see the city to the north, while to the south you see the margin of a steep sided lake.  You reach out to touch the globe and it moves away from your hand.  }

They're ridged with sharp knobs and spikes.  You could wear the heavy hide as armor, although it's probably of greater value reworked by a skilled smith. The armour is in perfect condition.

On the flip side, it's perfect for smashing open inanimate objects, or jimmying locks, windows, and doors. This weapon is in excellent condition. This weapon deals edged and blunt damage. This weapon is class 5 (blunt). }

This weapon deals edged and mind damage. This weapon is a class higher than 15 (edged)  This weapon gains benefits from your sword weapon skill. You must be level 17 to wield this weapon. It looks light. You crush the ancient pottery against the ground. The vase crumbles apart, apparently something was inside.

The dark entrance to an elven home is here.   / | \\  This once mighty tree now only serves as a grim reminder to the former glory of Der'Thalas.

An eerie moaning can be heard somewhere in the far distance of this dark and evil wood.  Looking northwest and south you can see massive trees, dark and foreboding.  The path follows east and west from here, deep into the tainted woods. NE     \\ | /     / | \\  Rivulets of fear ooze down your spine, chilling your soul.  Your heart pounds within its chest as you tread through this unholy forest.  Nothing is so evil as that of tainted goodness.  The horror wells up inside of you.  You only hope that your mind will not succumb to the terrors that await you.  In the dark sky above you, the pale moon shines down upon your death.  Twisting into the sky like a shadowed serpent, an abandoned elven housetree slithers toward the silver moon southwest of here.  The vile path leads northeast and west through the forest from here.

This room starts with a monster in it at least sometimes. Bonehead, you're at max hit points already. Metallic dagger The dagger is made out of plain steel. Its edges are sharp and in the hands of someone who knows how to use it you'd guess it would cause some serious pain. The hilt is made from unadorned wood that's been carved to fit comfortably in the hand. Dark leather straps wrap around it helping prevent slips and other unfortunate accidents. This weapon is in excellent condition. This weapon deals edged damage. This weapon is a class higher than 15 (edged) This weapon gains benefits from your dagger weapon skill. You must be level 17 to wield this weapon. It looks heavy. Tattered boots The shoes are stitched pieces of leather that's been soaked in some sort of softening solution. They seem durable and would serve the wearer well against rain and cold. The sole is slightly used but you'd guess they have still a fairly long way to go before they break. The boots are in perfect condition. This armor has the following resistances: 1 edged, 1 fire It looks light. #K%28189022BADPinnacle Morgue (n) #K%28189004DDDn #K%28189037FFFN~0~K~Mischievous ruffian~L~100~M~ Bonehead, you're at max hit points already. #K%28189009FFFN~0~K~ Bonehead, you're at max hit points already.

The top of the staff is adorned with an obsidian sphere, and the base of the staff is a human fist, with no flesh, holding a small sphere of black granite.  As you look carefully, you notice that blood streams out of the  obsidian sphere, and trickles down the length of the staff.  The blood then seems to be reabsorbed by the  granite sphere at its base.  The orbs pulse with a bright glow.  This weapon is in excellent condition. This weapon deals blunt damage. This weapon is a class higher than 15 (blunt)  This weapon gains benefits from your polearm weapon skill. You must be level 17 to wield this weapon. }

The massive and incredibly strong metal itself is enough to hold any thieves at bay. At the front is a small rectangular opening where you guess the key would fit.

While roughly humanoid in shape, the features are grotesquely alien in character.  What may well be eyes protrude from beneath a metal helmet atop what may well be a head.  Veiny muscle can be seen between the sinewy cords that trace the figures frame.  What this is made of is not readily apparent, but it is not ceramic, glass, plastic, or anything you'd normally find in a figurine's composition - it feels organic, save the very visible seam that runs along the sides, top, and bottom of the figure, suggesting that it may have been made in a mold of some sort after all.  It looks light. }

It is a large red gem, faceted on top, with a sharp platinum spike holding its base.  Mages and their followers would, if the need were desperate enough, insert the gem into their own foreheads, suffering terrible wounds and a substantial loss of his intelligence in the process. When the gem is properly inserted it constantly boosts its owner's mental and physical energies, allowing him to remain in combat for longer durations. The Mages where NEVER REQUIRED to remove the gems, but due to the controlling nature of the gems, most removed them at some point in their career. Sadly when the eye is removed from the owner's head it rips his soul from his body, permanently lowering his intelligence, destroying the eye in the process.  It looks light. }

Deadman: 0 a suit of plasteel bodyarmour  This set of armour is made of a synthetic polymer named plasteel after its invention in the early twenty-first century.  It combines the protection of a dense metal with the flexibility and weight of plastic.  Hydrogen bonds are created between the polymer chains which in turn form a radial orientation that provides phenomenal protection from the atomic level up.

Yet despite its aged appearance, it's still quite charming. The other is in perfect condition.  It looks light. }
