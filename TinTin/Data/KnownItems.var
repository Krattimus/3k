Looking over the thick foliage, you notice the remnants of small wooden planks here, that spread out to the north.  From the current point you cannot see what may lie across the river, as a gloomy haze stands prominently to the north obscuring any view  in that direction. feet make contact with the small ferry dock below you.  Off to the side, the river does not look particularly inviting, and it might be best to avoid falling in.  Droplets of drizzle cover the wooden planks, causing the surface to appear oily in the flickering moonlight.

A set of shallow hills juts out from the banks that lie across the river, and one could begin to appreciate the great size and natural beauty of this region. }

            {Description} {  Dark grey welding mask  This is a long and narrow welding mask. In the front there is a dark plexiglass eyeshield. Around the sides and the back are dark grey pieces of plastic that look like they hold the mask in place. The helmet is in perfect condition. This armor has the following resistances: 9 edged, 9 blunt, 9 fire, 9 acid, 9 electric It looks light.   As you step through the very large garage door in the entrance of this autorepair shop, you get the strong scent of motor oil and burning rags. There is a large sign hanging over the door, and large lights hang from the ceiling shining down on the car that looks to be under repair below them. It looks as if this shop is very heavily used by someone. Dark shadows flicker from the corners of the garage. This probably isn't the best of places for someone who's not from Detroit and has never worked in a greasy repair shop in the middle of a gang district. }

They remind you of burnt marshmallows that you loved so much as a kid.  Now you can't fathom ever touching a smore again.  You can barely even tell they were once humans\; however, one dismembered hand appears to have avoided the majority of the damage.  It lies forlornly on the outskirts of the body pile. }

Its plain ebony sides possess the dull sheen of age and use, and its lid does not appear to fit quite right, leaving small gaps around the edges of the coffin.  A careful  inspection of the coffin reveals etchings which may be 'read' to disclose its secrets. Strange, shimmering shadows swirl around the edges of the coffin, which seem to shift and blur before your eyes.  This phantasmagorical interplay of  powerful magic and reality suggests that there is far more to this coffin than meets the eye. There seems to be something etched on the coffin. It contains seven corpses. It looks heavy. }

The helmet is in perfect condition. This armor has the following resistances: 1 edged, 1 blunt It looks light.   }

            {Description} {     Pinch of wormrose  Wormrose is a small green flower that grows in the more moist areas. Usually you dry it and then crush the petals into a fine powder which can then be used in potions and elixirs and even as a seasoning. It's fairly cheap to come by even though it doesn't grow anywhere near Westersea.  It looks light.   Psionic waves emanate from your body. }

When the gem is properly inserted it constantly boosts its owner's mental and physical energies, allowing him to remain in combat for longer durations. The Mages where NEVER REQUIRED to remove the gems, but due to the controlling nature of the gems, most removed them at some point in their career. Sadly when the eye is removed from the owner's head it rips his soul from his body, permanently lowering his intelligence, destroying the eye in the process.  It looks light. }
