Off to the side, the river does not look particularly inviting, and it might be best to avoid falling in.  Droplets of drizzle cover the wooden planks, causing the surface to appear oily in the flickering moonlight.

A set of shallow hills juts out from the banks that lie across the river, and one could begin to appreciate the great size and natural beauty of this region. }

Surprisingly, it appears to stay cool after every shot despite the intense heat of the plasma rounds it sprays out. From looking at the inner workings, it appears you could load other rounds into it and the device that preheats the plasma shells would still charge the new rounds in a similar fashion. This weapon is in excellent condition. This weapon deals fire and magic damage. This weapon is class 10 (energy).  This weapon gains benefits from your gun weapon skill. The plasma shotgun is currently not loaded. It looks heavy.   CB:  }

Deadman: 0  Deadman: 0    Small beads of water sit on the dusty floor here like dark gray gems.  Your lights sparkle off their pristine ovoid surfaces.  The hallway ends here in a rounded out cavern, that looks like it may have been used for storage, or given the faint odour perhaps a bathroom.  The almost featureless hallway was cut through the gray marl beneath the city.  }

The wooden handle on this has some burning done to it.  The owner must be a fan of the Green Bay Packers because there is a big 'G' on the grip with some other scribblings around that.  Although small, if used in experienced hands, this could be a weapon for things other than the dead fish it normally sees. This weapon is in very good condition. This weapon deals edged damage. This weapon is class 6 (edged).  This weapon gains benefits from your dagger weapon skill. It looks light.  Deadman: 0 After dropping the line in the water, you wait for signs of even a nibble.

Needless to say, it isn't too happy with your actions and proceeds to inform you of that fact.  OUCH!  You decide to cut the line and release it. You steadily block the brunt of the incoming attack.

You must be level 17 to wield this weapon. It looks heavy.     }

The grasses make it difficult to see any lurking foe.  An island of serenity in an otherwise chaotic setting, the parkland is filled with waving long grasses, and offers through its open setting a fine opportunity to view the city beyond its borders.  Through thick trees and overgrown brush you see the city to the north, while to the south you see the margin of a steep sided lake.  You reach out to touch the globe and it moves away from your hand.  }

Its plain ebony sides possess the dull sheen of age and use, and its lid does not appear to fit quite right, leaving small gaps around the edges of the coffin.  A careful  inspection of the coffin reveals etchings which may be 'read' to disclose its secrets. Strange, shimmering shadows swirl around the edges of the coffin, which seem to shift and blur before your eyes.  This phantasmagorical interplay of  powerful magic and reality suggests that there is far more to this coffin than meets the eye. There seems to be something etched on the coffin. It contains seven corpses. It looks heavy. }

A dark shadow on the northern wall looks like it might be a fireplace, long dead and stone cold. You cannot clearly make out anything else in the room and shiver slightly at the spartan loneliness of this place. }

Veiny muscle can be seen between the sinewy cords that trace the figures frame.  What this is made of is not readily apparent, but it is not ceramic, glass, plastic, or anything you'd normally find in a figurine's composition - it feels organic, save the very visible seam that runs along the sides, top, and bottom of the figure, suggesting that it may have been made in a mold of some sort after all.

It's coated by a glossy surface that resembles glass but the whole garment is moving and flowing beautifully in the air. As you inspect the collar, you fail at first to see the transparent neck strap that is used to attach it. However it doesn't look nearly as clumsy and uncomfortable as other cloaks. The cloak is in perfect condition. This armor has the following resistances: 4 edged, 4 blunt It looks light. }

Wrapped around the bottom as well as the top are golden lines that are more ornamentation rather than providing function. The massive and incredibly strong metal itself is enough to hold any thieves at bay. At the front is a small rectangular opening where you guess the key would fit. Unfortunately you have no idea where the one which fits this particular lock might be so you just have to try your best to 'pick' it. }

While roughly humanoid in shape, the features are grotesquely alien in character.  What may well be eyes protrude from beneath a metal helmet atop what may well be a head.  Veiny muscle can be seen between the sinewy cords that trace the figures frame.  What this is made of is not readily apparent, but it is not ceramic, glass, plastic, or anything you'd normally find in a figurine's composition - it feels organic, save the very visible seam that runs along the sides, top, and bottom of the figure, suggesting that it may have been made in a mold of some sort after all.

When the gem is properly inserted it constantly boosts its owner's mental and physical energies, allowing him to remain in combat for longer durations. The Mages where NEVER REQUIRED to remove the gems, but due to the controlling nature of the gems, most removed them at some point in their career. Sadly when the eye is removed from the owner's head it rips his soul from his body, permanently lowering his intelligence, destroying the eye in the process.  It looks light. }
