Bonehead, you're at max hit points already. Ruinic Cloak of the Triad (ensorcelled) The ruinic cloak is adorned with blood colored runes that have been embedded within the fabric.  The material is coarse and not entirely light weight, however, it will still provide rather decent protection against the elements of nature.  The symbols upon the apparel vary in design and you surmize that their presence marks this piece of clothing as one with magical properties.  The cloak is in perfect condition. It has a magical glow about it. This armor has the following resistances: 1 edged, 1 blunt, 3 fire, 3 ice, -3 acid, 9 electric, -2 mind, 9 energy It looks light.  Deadman: 0  Deadman: 0 The thick mist makes seeing anything beyond it an arduous task.  In the distance, a faint howling noise can be heard.  It echoes throughout the forest and its presence only intensifies the perception that the surrounding darkened wood is indeed haunted.  }

The hallway ends here in a rounded out cavern, that looks like it may have been used for storage, or given the faint odour perhaps a bathroom.  The almost featureless hallway was cut through the gray marl beneath the city.  }

The powder is said to offer superior protection against acidic damage and seems to have made these gauntlets surprisingly good armour. The gauntlets are slightly larger than a pair ideally suited for a man, obviously created for the goblins that gave them their name. Painted in blood upon each is the image of a raging dragon in flight, spitting acid at a cowering warrior beneath. The gloves are in perfect condition. This armor has the following resistances: >4 edged, >4 blunt, >4 fire, >4 acid  You must be level 10 to wear this.  It looks light.    }

Scuff marks can be seen on the ground, as if a struggle might have occurred recently. Dried blood is splattered on the walls as well. The cave leads deeper underground up ahead or you could choose discretion over valor and head back to the cave entrance behind you. =I= The electrocuted, freshly slain corpse of Rotting zombie. }

            {Description} { A mythical device of insane power, the runestaff.  The staff is deep red, and seems heavy considering its size. It is imperfect in shape.  There is a tiny fold at the top of the staff, making it appear somehow deformed.  It seems almost as if the top part was exposed to some sort of extreme heat which wore it down.  Eight scroll slots run down the staff from top to bottom. The slots are for scrolls of a stygian dragon, a stone giant, a behemoth hydra, an Elysian chimera, an arcane mummy, a hideous medusa, an apollyon dragon, and finally a flame giant Warlord.  Perhaps waving the runestaff would cause some kind of effect. It looks light. }

The grasses make it difficult to see any lurking foe.  An island of serenity in an otherwise chaotic setting, the parkland is filled with waving long grasses, and offers through its open setting a fine opportunity to view the city beyond its borders.  Through thick trees and overgrown brush you see the city to the north, while to the south you see the margin of a steep sided lake.  You reach out to touch the globe and it moves away from your hand.  }

            {Description} {   Small Figurine  This tiny figurine appears to be made in the image of a Balangool creature, though not one you can recall having seen before.  While roughly humanoid in shape, the features are grotesquely alien in character.  What may well be eyes protrude from beneath a metal helmet atop what may well be a head.  Veiny muscle can be seen between the sinewy cords that trace the figures frame.  What this is made of is not readily apparent, but it is not ceramic, glass, plastic, or anything you'd normally find in a figurine's composition - it feels organic, save the very visible seam that runs along the sides, top, and bottom of the figure, suggesting that it may have been made in a mold of some sort after all.  It looks light.

When the gem is properly inserted it constantly boosts its owner's mental and physical energies, allowing him to remain in combat for longer durations. The Mages where NEVER REQUIRED to remove the gems, but due to the controlling nature of the gems, most removed them at some point in their career. Sadly when the eye is removed from the owner's head it rips his soul from his body, permanently lowering his intelligence, destroying the eye in the process.  It looks light. }

Wearing this cloak would alter many of the complex chemical reactions that the body carries forth each second, and could be dangerous, even lethal, if the body it alters does not have the constitution to withstand such a change.  Emblazoned onto the back of the coat and glowing fiercely are the initials 'DSK'. This item is legendary and you cannot possess more than one. The cloak is in perfect condition.
